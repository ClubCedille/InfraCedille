# CEDILLE Wiki

This wiki is the primary resource for our members and partners. It contains
information about our projects, services, and best practices. Whether you are a
developer, a system administrator, or an end-user, we have information to help
you get familiar with the CEDILLE platform and make the most of it.

Here, you will find detailed guides, tutorials, best practices information, and
answers to your most frequently asked questions. We have worked hard to make
this documentation as clear and accessible as possible, but since everything is
new, we are eager to receive your feedback to further improve it!

## Background

The CEDILLE platform was designed to meet our clients' needs for hosting
services on bare-metal servers. It is based on Kubernetes, an open-source
containerization technology that offers exceptional flexibility and scalability
for deploying and managing services.

Our goal is to provide a simple, reliable, and high-performance hosting platform
for our clients while offering our team members an educational and enriching
development and deployment experience.
