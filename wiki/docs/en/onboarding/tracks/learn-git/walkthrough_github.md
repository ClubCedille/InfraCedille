### 1. Download Git CLI

First, you need to [download the Git Command-Line Interface](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### 2. Set up Git

Once installed, configure your Git credentials with these commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "yourEmail@example.com"
```

### 3. Authenticate with your Github Account

Github needs to know that your account is connected with your machine.
