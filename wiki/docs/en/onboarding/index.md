## Context and objectives

This integration process helps new members get familiar with our environment, tools, and culture. It aims to make them quickly productive and give them an overall understanding of our projects and their impact.

## CEDILLE philosophy

We aim to bridge the gab between the academic world and the industry by making knowledge and technology accessible to all. We promote open-source, collaboration, and Infrastructure as Code to ensure transparency and simplicity. With a DevOps approach, we encourage continuous experimentation and collective growth.

Our club is a space where a passion for technology allows every member to participate, learn, and build concrete projects that serve the student community at Ã‰TS. We train future engineers to take on real-world challenges, with a drive to innovate and transform the industry today.

## Our standards
